      <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images of dogs,
        regarding the dog breed they depict. 8351 images of dogs were available for training and testing of the CNN.
        This is a rather small dataset for optimizing millions of weights needed within a CNN and to achieve good final
        classification results. Therefor it was intended to make use of Transfer Learning.<br>
        In Transfer Learning a pre-trained model is used, which is able to classify similar objects, and it's knowledge
        in form of the pretrained weights and the architecture is used as input to the final network-architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project models trained on Imagenet were used for Transfer Learning. Imagenet is a DataSet containing
        millions of images depicting 1000 different classes, including 120-dog-classes which is ideal for the project's
        goals. Because of the small DataSet and the similarity between our classification goal and the classes used in
        training these CNNs, the end of these pre-trained models were simply 'cut off' without readjusting their
        weights. The ends are replaced by an own set of Dense layers mapping to the final desired 133 dog-breed
        classes. In parts also additional convolutional layers were added. You can see the individual architectures of
        the final 'on top' models in the export of the <a href="./code#from_scratch">jupyter notebook</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final trained models are now deployed in this webapp where you can upload your own images of dogs or humans
        and see whether they contain a dog or a human and which dog-breed it resembles the most.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Until now three models were trained. One model without usage of transfer learning, one model built on top of the
        VGG16 model and one build upon the Resnet50-model. The DataSet of the dog-images was subdivided in a training,
        validation and testing set. For measuring the final quality of the models, the accuracy on the testing-set was
        assessed.
        <ul>
          <li>The model without TL ('from_scratch') achieved an accuracy of 28.0%</li>
          <li>The model built upon VGG16 an accuracy of 62.3%</li>
          <li>The model built upon Resnet50 an accuracy of 80.6%</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The numbers might seem small, but given 133 classes, random choice would lead to an average accuracy of only 0.75%.
        I find it very astonishing that with a very small, relatively simple model, like I build myself from scratch and
        the limitations based on time, amount of reference data and computational power, accuracies of ~30% were achieved.
